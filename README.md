# Explode-to-Win
Multiplayer Game - 2D Block Based

Explode to Win is a multiplayer game where two teams fight for the control of a safe.

Gameplay features :

  The Red Team has a fixed amount of time to open the safe and to bring the content back to its base. Meanwhile, the Blue   Team does its best to stop the progress of the enemies.
  
  Given that the game is based on a block environment in 2D, it includes a map editor with numerous possibilities. 
  Nearly everything is possible, one just has to take the time to do it.
  
  In order to allow players to chose between different strategies, the player can chose a class among the ones available.
  Each class has its own items : one specific weapon with its own characteristics and special objects which can be placed to help your team take the lead. Those items range from a simple block the player can placed to either hamper the enemy team or create new opportunities to a shovel and a camera.
  Thanks to those classes, the attacking team may chose to reach the safe from above using a zip-line, dig a long and undetected tunnel across the map or simply rush fully armed.
  Finally, each player may only see what he and his team can see in front of them, so that the strategy chosen by their enemies remain hidden until they discover it.
	
Technical features :

  As the game is a multi-player one, it has been necessary to develop two side-applications : the server which echoes the messages sent by one client to the rest and the client itself, responsible of the link between the game and the server.
